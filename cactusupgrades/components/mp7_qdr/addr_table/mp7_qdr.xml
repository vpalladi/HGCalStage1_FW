<!--
   
   Note that the RAM transfers 72bits per transaction.
   This has been split into 64bits plus 8bits parity
   If the add LSB = 0 then access is to 31:00 else 63:32
   Write/Read should occur in pairs: e.g. 
   
    - Write add(0)=0, then add(0)=1
    - The write to the RAM will not take place until the 2nd word is sent.
   
    - Read add(0)=0, then add(0)=1
    - The read to the RAM will occur on the 1st word request.
     
   If a parity error or calibration error is detected an ipbus bus err 
   will be generated.
   
   The RAM itself runs from a 125MHz clock and generates all 
   necesary extra clocks internally.  It could be changed to 120MHz
   if the user wanted to run at 1/2 the main processor clk.
    
   A FIFO bridges to/from the QDR/IPBus clock domain.
   
   There are 2 designs: 
   
   qdr_test
   --------
   The 1st just lights up a couple of LEDs that should be green 
   if all is well.  

   qdr_ipbus
   ---------
   The 2nd contains the ipbus interface described above.
