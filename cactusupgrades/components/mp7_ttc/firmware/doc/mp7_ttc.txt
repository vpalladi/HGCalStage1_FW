	<node id="ttc" address="0x0" description="MP7 TTC block" tags="slave">
	
This block contains the control registers for the TTC decoder block, and the various
LHC counters.

		<node id="ctrl" address="0x0">
			<node id="ttc_enable" mask="0x1"/>
			
Set to enable L1A and B-commands from the external (AMC13) TTC input.			

			<node id="err_ctr_clear" mask="0x2"/>
			
Set to clear the single and double error counters (clears on rising edge only).			

			<node id="l1a_send" mask="0x4"/>
			
Set to issue a single L1A - there is currently no way to specify the
BX on which this happens.
			
			<node id="int_bc0_enable" mask="0x8"/>
			
Set to enable the internal BC0 generator. This issues a BC0 command when the bunch
counter reaches the maximum value of 3564. Note that if the bunch counter has
already overflowed, it must be reset for internal BC0 to start being issued.
			
			<node id="mask_hist_bc0" mask="0x10"/>
			
Set to prevent BC0 commands being recorded in the history buffer. All B-commands
(including BC0) are recorded by default.
			
			<node id="fill_hist_buf" mask="0x20"/>
			
Set to begin filling the history buffer (begins on rising edge, stops only when full).
		
			<node id="m_del_inc" mask="0x40"/>
			
Set to increment the fine delay setting for the TTC signal sampling clock. In the
MP7, each increment causes an additional delay of ~52ps. The delay can be reset
using the overall TTC block reset via the board control register. Typically used
for finding the optimal clock delay for a new board, should not be used in normal
operation.
			
			<node id="ctr_clear" mask="0x80"/>
			
Set to clear the LHC counters (clears on rising edge only).

			<node id="buf_go" mask="0x100"/>
			
Set to fill the capture buffers (edge-sensitive).

			<node id="b_send" mask="0xff0000"/>
			
Specifies an arbitrary B-command to send internally. The command is sent as soon
as the register is set, so keep this at zero unless you wish to issue a B-command
with every write to this location. There is currently no way to specify the BX
on which the command is issued (make a feature request if you want this!).

			<node id="c_del" mask="0xff000000"/>
			
Specifies the global delay to all external (AMC13) TTC signals in BX.
			
		</node>
		<node id="stat0" address="0x4">
			<node id="bunch_ctr" mask="0xfff"/>
			
LHC bunch counter (0 -> 0xdeb).

			<node id="del_rdy" mask="0x10000000"/>
			
Flag indicating that TTC sampling clock fine delay block is ready for use.
			
		</node>
		<node id="stat1" address="0x5">
			<node id="evt_ctr" mask="0xffffff"/>
			
LHC event counter (starts at 0x1 after reset, a la CMS rules)
			
		</node>
		<node id="stat2" address="0x6">
			<node id="orb_ctr" mask="0xffffff"/>
			
LHC orbit counter (starts at 0x0 after reset - correct or not?)
			
		</node>
		<node id="stat3" address="0x7">
			<node id="single_biterr_ctr" mask="0xffff"/>
			
TTC decoder single bit error counter.
			
			<node id="double_biterr_ctr" mask="0xffff0000"/>
			
TTC decoder double bit error counter.
			
		</node>
	</node>
	<node id="ttc_freq" address="0x8" description="TTC frequency counter" tags="slave">
	
This block contains frequency counters for various generated clocks within the
chip. The register contains the number of clock cycles counted during 64k clock
cycles of the ipbus clock (currently running at 31.250MHz).
	
		<node id="clk40_freq" address="0x0"/>
		<node id="clk240_freq" address="0x1"/>
	</node>
	<node id="ttc_hist_buf" address="0xa" description="TTC history buffer" tags="slave"/>
	
This block gives access to a history buffer which records every L1A and B-command
received via the TTC system (either externally or interally generated). The buffer
is a FIFO which is triggered, and then records commands until it fills. The FIFO
can be read out at any time, including when it is filling. Each FIFO entry is
two sequential words:

Word 0:
	b31:	Entry valid
	b24:	L1A on this corrsing (since L1A can coincide with B-command)
	b19-8:	LHC BX number
	b7-0:	TTC command (can be zero if there is an L1A)

Word 1:
	b23:0: LHC orbit number
