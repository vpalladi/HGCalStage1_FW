MP7 network management using ipmitool
-------------------------------------

** Introduction

This document assumes that the crate MCH is on the network at address
192.168.0.41 and has a blank username/password.

To set the net info of a card you need to convert its slot number to an IPMB-L
address, the formula for this is (for slot S in range 1 - 12): Addr = 0x70 + (S * 2)
i.e. the following lookup table (uTCA.0 SPEC R1.0 Page 3-12):
Slot-Addr
 1-0x72   2-0x74   3-0x76   4-0x78   5-0x7A   6-0x7C
 7-0x7E   8-0x80   9-0x82  10-0x84  11-0x86  12-0x88

The examples below will use slot 11 (i.e. 0x86) as the example. Be careful to
not confuse it with the 0x82 address, which is the IPMB-0 address of the carrier
manager (and should not be changed).


** Getting the network info:

ipmitool -H 192.168.0.41 -P "" -B 0 -T 0x82 -b 7 -t 0x86 raw 0x30 0x04

This returns: IP[0] .. IP[3] MAC[0] .. MAC[5] FLAGS

i.e. for a card with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:55 and IP address 192.168.1.123, the
following would be output:
 c0 a8 01 7b 00 11 22 33 44 55 00

Flags (returned as 0x00 in the above example) is a bitmask. The only bit that is
currently used is 0x80, if this is set then the network parameters have been
changed, but not written to the EEPROM.


** Setting network info:

First set the MAC (to 00:11:22:33:44:55 in this example):

ipmitool -H 192.168.0.41 -P "" -B 0 -T 0x82 -b 7 -t 0x86 raw 0x30 0x02 0x00 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55

Then set the IP (to 192.168.1.123 in this case):

ipmitool -H 192.168.0.41 -P "" -B 0 -T 0x82 -b 7 -t 0x86 raw 0x30 0x03 0xC0 0xA8 0x01 0x7B

Finally (optionally) save the settings to the EEPROM, if not saved the above
addresses will be used until the MMC is power cycled (the "data bytes" in this
command are just a magic word to prevent accidental EEPROM writes):

ipmitool -H 192.168.0.41 -P "" -B 0 -T 0x82 -b 7 -t 0x86 raw 0x30 0x01 0xFE 0xEF
