# MP7 Test infrastructure

## Organisation
Master script:

```
${MP7_TESTS}/scripts/utests/mp7jeeves.py
```


Test code, based on python nose package
```
${MP7_TESTS}/python/mp7nose
```


Custom nose plugins
```
${MP7_TESTS}/python/mp7nose/plugins
```

MP7 tests modules
```
${MP7_TESTS}/python/mp7nose/utests/*_tests.py
```


Some notes:
mp7jeeves.py is a customisation to nosetests. The customisation required to pass the MP7 connection parameters to test code.
This is achieved through a custom nose plugin called mp7loader.py. The pluging passes stores the uhal connection parameters and the board name in mp7nose.env.

MP7 test plugins should inherit from mp7nose.TestUnit. TestUnit provides a few methods to easily access to MP7 and MMC controllers.


```
cd tests
source env.sh
```

Run all tests belonging to a module and produce a nice html report

```

Run all tests known mp7 nose i.e. mp7nose submodules

```
mp7jeeves.py BOARDID mp7nose.utests --with-html
