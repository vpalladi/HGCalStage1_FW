In module's declaration or its instantiation, set the following
two generic parameters accroding to your design:

F_REFCLK is the frequency of the GTX reference clock
USE_TRIGGER_PORT is default to false, but if you have trigger data
to be sent through the link, you must set it to true and provide
the trigger data together with BC0 and TTCclk.

please include the following line in your xst file:

create_clock -period 4.000 -name DAQ_usrclk [get_pins */i_DAQ_Link_7s/i_UsrClk/o]

where i_DAQ_Link_7s is the instance name of the module DAQ_Link_7s
in its upper level module.
